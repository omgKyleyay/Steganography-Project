# Steganography-Project
Image Steganography
1.) Decode button does not do anything- has not been programmed.
2.) Note that the larger image must be 8 times larger than the smaller image, or else you will get
    an array out of bounds error.
    Choose the original image, and then choose the image you want to hide within the first.
